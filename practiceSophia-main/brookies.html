	<h1>Brookies Dessert</h1>

<p> Part brownie, part chocolate chip cookie: BROOKIES are one of my favorite recipes! They are rich and a combination of two of my favorite desserts.

Do not worry: it is easy to make homemade Brookies. A brookie is a dessert mashup of epic proportions: itâ€™s part brownie and part cookie.  </p>
